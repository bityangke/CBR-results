# CBR-results
This repo holds the test results for the paper "Cascaded Boundary Regression for Temporal Action Detection, BMVC 2017". One can use these files and THUMOS-14 official eval code to re-produce our results on THUMOS-14 shown in the paper.

CBR is built on top of [TURN](https://github.com/jiyanggao/TURN-TAP). Once CBR codes is cleaned, we will release them in this repo.
